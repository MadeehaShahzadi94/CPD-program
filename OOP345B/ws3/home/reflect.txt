Reflection
Explain in your own words what you have learned in completing this workshop.
Answer:
I have studies about different concepts in this workshop. I learn 
about templates and their specialization.I also learned about
function and clases templates . Moreover i also learn how can we 
inherit one template class from other. I also learn about object creation
of tempalted clases.

The reason for specializing the sum() member function.
Answer:
We need to specialize the initial value for summation so that we can assign its
value to 0 or empty string. We had to specialize this because summation depends
on the type of label value pair. Hence for for int it was zero and for String it 
was initialised to an empty string.

The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation
Answer:
We need to define the class variable outside the class definition because these
variables needs separate memory allocation or may be they needs to be instantiated

The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition
Answer:
we need to specialize the sum to ensure that strings are properly concatenated
and because this function will get both label and value string so its necessary 
to specialize the sum so that it concatenates both string with space.

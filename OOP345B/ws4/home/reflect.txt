What I Learn in this workshop?
I learned many things about this workshop especially special member functions and how it is work. Secondly, I learned how the ** work and learned 3 components of functions. 1. Composition, Aggregation and Association. I am surprise when I saw the composition is die when main obj is die.

the difference between the implementations of a composition and an aggregation.
Composition is died means that if main object is dying other object that is related to the main object is also die. (Move Constructor)
Aggregation is not like composition because if the main object is dying, other object do not died (copy Constructor)

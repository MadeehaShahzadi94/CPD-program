
What I have learned:

I have studies about different concepts in this workshop. Firstly, I learn
about anonymous struct that has no name and tag I learn about its declaration
and usages. I also learned about copy constructor and copy assignment operator 
and move constructor and move assignment operator and their implementation 
. Moreover, I learn about chrono library and objects creation. I also learn
about some built in function like now and how we can use them as stopwatch
to start and stop the time. This part of the workshop is most interesting and most difficult to understand for me. 

Question 1: the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations?
There is a difference in the way, you should take the parameter.
Copy assignment should take its parameter by a const lvalue reference (&), because you should not change the source of your assignment
Move assignment should take its parameter by a non-const rvalue reference (&&), because you have to modify the source of your assignment
